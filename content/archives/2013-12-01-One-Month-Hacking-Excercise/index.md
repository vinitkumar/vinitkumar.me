After a lot of meditation about what I have achieved in last one year, I have stumbled upon one fact. I need to hack
a lot more on Python and JavaScript. These are two main languages I am comfortable with and almost all my projects
and official work is done with them.

Well, here are some small ideas about how I am going to achieve this:

- Read a lot of Good code. I will spend at least 1 hour everyday reading some really awesome python code.
- Write a lot of commonly used utilities in Python. For example: Automate at least one of the task I daily do using Python.
- Read Django Documentation and toy with it.
- Write PEP8 compliant code.

These were the ideas for Python, Now for JavaScript:

- Give a solid foundation to my understanding of prototypical inheritance in JavaScript.
- Write a lot of Backbone and some really good jQuery Code.
- Read some really good code and write some coffeeScript as well.
- Learn writing good unit tests in Jasmine and Mocha.
