There are lot of useful plugins for Django CMS.
Well, this plugin let you use the images from a Facebook Album. Currently it supports fetching images from Photo Album of a Facebook Page.

All you need to do is to put Facebook Album URL, Access-token and the album name in the plugin fields and you will get a nice thumbnail in the intended place and once clicked big images will open in carousel effects. Sounds nice, take a look at the screen-shots below.

- Entering the details in plugin form:
