title: Moving from Vim to NeoVim
date: "2021-06-05"
description: "The blog details my shift from Vim to NeoVim, driven by NeoVim's recent progress and enhanced plugin support. Motivated to use Lua for configuration, the author aims for efficient autocomplete with native LSP, a modular setup, and the ability to write custom plugins. The post touches on terminal app experimentation and concludes with the successful transition, sharing the author's NeoVim configuration on GitHub: [https://github.com/vinitkumar/nvim](https://github.com/vinitkumar/nvim)."

# Why Move?

Neovim has made significant progress in last 6 months (I am using 0.5-dev branch as my daily driver for more than 6 months now).
There has been a significant number of good plugins (e.g. Telescope) and many others (some of them are just lua based).

At present, I have a pretty great Vim setup and a nice NeoVim setup too. However, my neovim config is vim script based, but I want to use Lua for config. For this, I will start porting my `init.vim` to `init.lua` and switch completely to lua for all my vim config needs.
Lua is a nice little language, and it would be fun getting good at it and at the same time have good fun.

I want to get the autocomplete story in Neovim better or at par with what I have vim (COC.nvim and Vim). I could just use COC in neovim too, but I want to use the native LSP in Neovim for this purpose. My goal is to ultimately reduce the config to a minimum and settle on a small list of plugins which I can go with zone whenever I open my editor.

I'm also experimenting with terminal apps at the moment. I use iTerm2 (most convenient), but also Alacritty and Kitty (It is pretty great except it sucks with SSH, and its author doesn't want to work on that; hence I uninstalled it). Furthermore, I would  prefer not to change the terminal just to SSH.

## Following are the requirements and goals for this port

Requirements for port:
- autocomplete works and is always fast.

Ideal Neovim Setup:

- Config written in lua
- Modular, programmable setup
- Be able to use the latest goodness
- Ability to write custom plugins
- Learn Lua

EDIT: I have moved to Neovim completely. Here is my pure LUA config and I think I really like using Neovim. Here is the configuration that if you are interested to take a look. (https://github.com/vinitkumar/nvim)
