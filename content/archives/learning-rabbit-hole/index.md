We live in an age where if we set out to learn something new, you need to learn basics first. This is true when you are out to learn it deeply.

A shallow understanding won't take you far. But acquiring deep knowledge takes considerable effort and requires you to learn consistently for a long time.

Let me present an example:

__Kubernetes__ is one of the hottest techs at this point. I have to try to get a better understanding of it for some time. Now knowing kubernetes requires you to master these.

- Understand the networking stack, subnets, DNS
- Understand containers, docker
- Commands for the tools required to talk to Kubernetes like `kubectl`, `kubens`, and `kubectx`.
- YAML (you need to get proficient writing, reading and debugging YAML)
- Understand latency, redundancy, and scalability.
- Write and Understand Go(Kubernetes is in Go) so it will help you to know go so that you can script some part of it using the same stack.
- Read enough horror/war stories using Kubernetes, something like (https://k8s.af). Those who don't learn from other's mistakes are going to repeat it
- Another example could be learning backend development with Django.

Django comes with batteries included, but they are not free. The features come at a cost of you learning that.

- Understand how the model layer works. Also, means that you understand how SQL works behind the scenes. One can't be a master if they know the ORM and not the SQL underlying it.
- Understand the basic HTTP Request/Response Cycle if you want to build efficient web services
- Understand Caching(Redis/Memcache) to scale a production website.
- Understand the Queuing system like RabbitMQ, Celery to run a production-grade website
- Learn Python (preferably Python3) and the meta-programming well to program Django app efficiently.
- Learn important libraries like DRF(Django Rest Framework) to build correct and RESTful APIs.
- Authentication. Authorization and Security are important as well.

The key here is to plan for the long term and not short term learning. Shallow/Little knowledge is dangerous and always comes back to bite.
