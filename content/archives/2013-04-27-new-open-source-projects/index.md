Maintaining and contributing to an Open Source Project is a very important part of a developers life. 
Luckily, i am in a Company that gives me full liberty to contribute and in fact we have a 
Open Source day(Friday) where we could open source reusable components of project 
we have been working on to the open source audience.

This is plain awesome, because not only it encourages a healthy culture of giving back 
to the community, also it improves the overall quality of the project as you just do not open source 
anything without getting it better.

With that said, I have open sourced two of my projects:

[cmsplugin-fbalbum](https://github.com/vinitcool76/cmsplugin-fbalbum):

This is a django-cms plugin that gives the end user to showcase the photos 
from their Facebook album without going through any code. Just enter the album
name, album URL and access-token and you are good to go.
It is also available to everyone on pypi, In order to install just do:
```
pip install cmsplugin-fbalbum
```

It is under heavy development and still in beta, but can be used. Any sort of contribution is welcome.

[googlecl](https://github.com/vinitcool76/googlecl):

It is another dear project of mine, it was previously being developed 
by Google Engineer, Tom.H.Miller. Since he is quite busy nowadays and could not contribute actively, 
I have decided to maintain this project on GitHub and add features/bugfixes and refactoring.

I am happy to have these two projects in progress and will open source
more of my stuff in future. Though i regret not blogging that often these days.
