These days i was busy working on an a project called as Node Twitter.
As the name suggest it is a twitter clone written on node. 

Right now it has following functionalities:

* Login via Facebook and Github
* Tweet Add, Modify, Delete
* Comment on Tweet
* Favorite a Tweet
* See own and another user's profile
* Follow another User

###Here are some screen-shots:

I am also planning to add all other features present on twitter one by one. Next would be dashboard(timeline), personal profile, retweet and hashtags.

These features might seem simple but most of them are not that simple and requires some good effort.
Anyways, you can test it here:
``` sh
$ npm install nwitter
$ npm start
```
Then open your browser and open `http://localhost:3000`.
