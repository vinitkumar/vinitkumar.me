I started programming JavaScript seriously in September 2012 and 
i never ever wondered that it will affect my life so much. 
Well, it started with me working on developing a Chrome Extension for a 
E-commerce/Social media app. Chrome is quite different for development. 
There are lots of APIs to learn and there are quite a few security restrictions. 
Also, there is only one language that you can use to develop it i.e JavaScript.

There are quite a few things i learned programming JavaScript:

- Think before you code, think about the whole problem at once.
- Keep code clean and use modular structure.
- Use Linting and follow good guidelines given by experts.
- Read some good books and be aware of what you are into.

Today i work as a Software Developer at an awesome Dutch startup [Changer](http://changer.nl).
