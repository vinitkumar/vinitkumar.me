A lot of things have changed recently. I converted from a hardcore Linux user
to Mac lover. I got a high end Macbook from Office.

There are quite some reasons for my fondness with mac :

- The OS X is quite good and amazingly stable.
- UI and UX is quite good once you get used to it.
- Almost every applications and tools under the sun is available to you.
- No messing up with hardwares, just connect and play.
- Awesome battery life, i could easily get 8 hours battery backup with this sweet machine.
- 13-inch is an awesome form factor.


Also, i recently got myself a HTC Desire X Android Smart phone.
It is a lovely piece of hardware. Not big or bulky. At 4-inch screen
i have enough screen estate to do whatever i can do. Camera is good as well.
All together i am quite satisfied with my phone. Did i mention Beats Audio?
It is an excellent addition to my phone. I spend quite some time traveling
to office and it seems to be a great feeling to listen to music while traveling.


Though i still love my 2 year old dell and Nokia E5.
Some repair and polishing is required and i will sure give them their due in right time.

I love my hardware and doesn't everyone else does too.
