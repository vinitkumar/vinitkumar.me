Today I discovered the power of CSS container queries, which solve a major limitation of traditional media queries.

## The Problem with Media Queries

Media queries only respond to viewport size, not the actual container size. This makes it difficult to create truly reusable components.

```css
/* Traditional media query - viewport based */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

## Container Queries Solution

```css
/* Container query - container based */
.sidebar {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (max-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

## Key Advantages

- **Component-aware**: Responds to actual container size
- **Reusable**: Same component works in different layouts
- **Predictable**: Behavior doesn't depend on viewport
- **Flexible**: Perfect for cards, widgets, and modular components

## Browser Support

Container queries are well-supported in modern browsers:
- Chrome 105+
- Firefox 110+
- Safari 16+

## Real-World Example

A card component that adapts based on its container width, not the viewport:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 300px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
  }
  
  .card-image {
    width: 100px;
    margin-right: 1rem;
  }
}
```

This enables truly modular, responsive components that work anywhere!
