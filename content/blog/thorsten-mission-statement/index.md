Here is a tweet from Thorsten Ball:

## Programming Principles


It was amazing to read this, but it was still an image, so I uploaded the image to ChatGPT and asked it to extract the text, which is as follows:

- Before all: write code for others.

- Working code is not enough.

- Write as little code as possible.

- Write code to be changed and deleted.

- Solve the problem behind the feature.

- Nurse your codebase like a garden.

- Beauty has a place in software development.

- Practice over theory. Theory is fantastic, but be mindful of the gap between practice and theory. And if you don't see the gap, you need more practice.

- Chop up the problem so that each problem is easy to understand and solve.

- Be fearless. Never be scared of looking into or touching code.

- I want to build robust systems that run for years on their own, that are easy to modify, in which bugs are easily spotted and removed.

- I want my systems to do their job and nothing more.

- Always strive towards high quality and know when tradeoffs need to be made.

- I value simplicity higher than easiness.

- "It works" is not good enough.

- I have a bad memory and I build systems with that in mind.

- I work with other people and the artifacts of my work should reflect that.

- Hacking is not programming, nor is professional software development.

- The history of the software is as important as its future.

- Robustness, simplicity, and maintainability are most important.

- The artifacts of my work should do what they promise to do.

- I care about my work and what I build.

- I love building.

- I strive to reduce things to their most simple form.

- Elegance.

- Remove what's not necessary.

- Carefulness and thoroughness are essential parts of my work, even when going fast.

- I strive for my work to be neat and uncluttered — "Ordentlichkeit".

- I invest in my tools. Knowing how my tools work is important. Knowledge of my tools will pay off.

- Knowledge further down in the stack gives me more leverage higher up.

- I favor the Unix philosophy.

- Predictability is more important than "magic".

- I try to work it out on my own, then ask other people.

- Asking for help is good. Helping others is good.

- I never want to hear myself say: "We do it this way, because we've always done it this way".

- I will always write code with debuggability and deletability in mind.

- It depends.

- Good programmers program a lot. "If you want to get better at benching you need to bench more" "Everybody wants to be a body builder, but nobody wants to lift those heavy ass weights"

- If you can do it in a single machine, do it in a single machine.

- If you can get away without state: database, cash, memory — do it.

- You should have a healthy amount of respect and fear of building distributed systems. If you don't, you're either missing something or you don't know the tools. Knowing how things break is important.

- If you think something not only has upsides, but no downsides, you probably haven't used it enough. Tradeoffs are the name of the game.

- Never fall for dogma. If you lean towards a dogmatic view — try the other side. You'll see why the dogma doesn't always apply.

- In the same vein: watch technologies and domains like a dog go faster.

- I always believed that technical debt can be avoided. Now I know:

    (1) taking on technical debt can be a conscious decision to go fast

    (2) not every bit of debt needs to be repaid immediately, some can linger and is not worth being repaid ever.
