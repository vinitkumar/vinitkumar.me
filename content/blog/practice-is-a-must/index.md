<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wouldn’t go that far. There is a base rate of practice for many things that is necessary to properly understand them. Without “putting in the reps”, which is rarely creative, you are doomed to a superficial understanding, and many great things only come from deep understanding.</p>&mdash; John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1311343418422046721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

John Carmack is a highly accomplished programmer, renowned for his exceptional expertise and extensive experience in the field. In a recent tweet, he emphasized the crucial role of diligent practice and the grind of dedication in attaining true mastery of a subject. Carmack asserts that without a commitment to consistent, focused practice, one may only attain a superficial understanding of the topic, hindering their ability to achieve greatness. I wholeheartedly agree with Carmack's perspective, having personally witnessed the rewards of dedicating oneself to mastering a skill through the grind of hard work and discipline. If you aspire to excel in a particular field, embrace the grind of hard work and discipline required to reach the pinnacle of greatness.
