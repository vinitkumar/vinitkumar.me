A lot of things have changed recently. I converted from a hardcore Linux user 
to Mac lover. I got a high-end MacBook from the office. 

There are quite a few reasons for my fondness for Mac:

- The OS X is quite good and amazingly stable.
- UI and UX are quite good once you get used to them.
- Almost every application and tool under the sun is available to you.
- No messing up with hardware, just connect and play.
- Awesome battery lifeâ€”I could easily get 8 hours of battery backup with this sweet machine.
- 13-inch is an awesome form factor.

Also, I recently got myself an HTC Desire X Android smartphone. 
It is a lovely piece of hardware. Not big or bulky. At 4 inches, the screen
gives me enough screen real estate to do whatever I need to do. The camera is good as well.
All together, I am quite satisfied with my phone. Did I mention Beats Audio? 
It is an excellent addition to my phone. I spend quite some time traveling 
to the office, and it feels great to listen to music while traveling.

Though I still love my 2-year-old Dell and Nokia E5. 
Some repair and polishing are required, and I will surely give them their due at the right time.

I love my hardware, and doesn't everyone else too?
