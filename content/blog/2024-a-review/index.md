2024 was one of the most interesting years of my life.

Family-wise, it was pretty good, and I got to spend time with family and friends. My kid started Grade 1, and it’s so much fun watching him make new friends and have fun with his friends. I also bought a new Guitar and started going to the same Music class my kid goes to for learning Piano. I always had a desire to learn it during college, but I couldn’t afford to do that. My wife has a big role in pushing me to pursue my interest in this.

I also had the first job change of my career. I worked on my last company for almost 12 years and around September 2024, I was informed that my time there was ending. It was a bittersweet moment since the original company was acquired 2 years ago, and the new work was not as fun. I quickly found a great company based in Pune and I am happy to say that I get to do cutting-edge work every day and I am treated very well by my colleagues and the management. Also, after a very long time, I get to work on some pretty challenging stuff and my neurons are firing again like crazy.

My wife and I also made a habit of walking like 5-6km every day after dropping my kid to School and that is one thing I enjoyed the most during the day.

One thing that didn’t turn out great was my time management and sleep. I had a horrible year of sleep and I would really like to focus on getting some good sleep and enjoying life more. I also sometimes let the work dictate my mood and well-being a lot and I would really like to just cut this habit out completely. Also, I want to cut Social Media by a significant percentage and use that time to do something productive or at least fun.
Finance-wise, it was an okay-ish year and I want to do better this year.

My Goal this year is to just enjoy life a bit more and be happy. I also want to avoid people who don’t bring joy to my life and surround myself with family and good friends. I am going to do a tonne of OSS work as that is the kind of work I always love doing. I also want to write more and more every day. I believe I can bring a huge change if I am just reasonably consistent and honest with my pursuits.
