I have always been a great fan of things around me that are simple to use and understand. In fact, each one of us appreciates things when they are simple. But life isn't so simple. So what should be done?

Well, we could reduce a lot of clutter on a personal level that is invading our life.

## Social Networks and Information Overload

These days I am getting upset or even irritated seeing some people posting crap on their social networks. Social networks were a great thing to share knowledge and information, but their overuse has just destroyed their true purpose. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against them, just that I don't appreciate them polluting my life and making it more and more complex.

I started experiencing these things about a year ago. After using Facebook for almost 5 years (joined in 2007) I finally stopped using it actively and these days mostly use it for work purposes or social compulsion. But I don't enjoy using them a bit. Not even a bit.

## Life's Higher Purpose

I feel life has a much higher purpose. We are here to solve problems and create a better life. Not to make it depressing or distasteful. I like meeting my friends in person, having a beer or grabbing some dinner. I don't just want to keep liking their photos and exuberant display of their life and get bored. Hell no.

## Technology Should Serve Us

I was meditating about the fact that technology is here to serve us and make our life easier. Not that we are meant to be hopeless people taking whatever technology is making us do. It really upsets me seeing that people respond so emotionally to all the PR stunts by different sets of people and do things that any sensible person wouldn't even think about doing.

I realize a lot of people from our generation have lost touch with reality and never think deeply about anything. A political party sets up a page on Facebook and everyone goes madly running after them. Why? Because it's the latest fad to do so? Do most of the people even understand anything about their agenda? Well, mostly they don't even have a clue.

## Moving Forward

Well, I don't really have any hope for these people who don't see these things, but I would be glad if anyone ponders about these things by reading this post.

Also, I would continue to take measures to stop this information overload and would strive to make my life simple, purposeful and happy to live.
