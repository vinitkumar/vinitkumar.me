## Morning

On Saturday morning, we usually try to sleep late since weekends provide our only opportunity for extra rest, but we had a dentist appointment scheduled for 10:30 AM. I served as the designated "Alarm Clock" since my family remains immune to all other wake-up calls. Rising at 8 AM, I took some time to clear my sleepy, foggy mind. My kid and wife woke up shortly after, and we quickly freshened up, had breakfast, and headed to the dentist's clinic. Despite arriving nine minutes late, they expected us since I had messaged their office beforehand. The procedure lasted about an hour, during which my kid and I kept ourselves entertained - I watched some old episodes of Big Bang Theory while he played games. Afterward, we proceeded to a nearby location for another doctor's appointment. While my wife attended her appointment, my kid and I enjoyed refreshing watermelon juice and buttermilk.

The afternoons in Pune grow increasingly hot, naturally drawing us toward cold refreshments. After the medical procedures and some shopping, we headed to an excellent Punjabi restaurant for lunch. Our meal consisted of fried rice, chapati, and Chicken Chili, accompanied by more buttermilk. I must confess my love for buttermilk - it's low in calories and perfect for summer. Though tempted by lassi, my wife reminded me of our sugar-restricted diet, so I contentedly settled for buttermilk instead. Following lunch, I called our music school, where my son studies piano and I learn guitar, requesting an earlier time slot due to our evening plans. Fortunately, they accommodated us. We completed our hour-long class before heading home to drop off our shopping items and continue to our next destination.

We reached the mall within 20 minutes and made a beeline for coffee. Despite being extra cautious after yesterday's coffee mishap, I managed to err again. While I ordered my usual Vietnamese Shakerato, I selected an Iced Cappuccino for my wife, which proved too watery. She typically prefers sugarless cold coffee with almond milk. I apologized for the mistake and promised to make it up to her.

Afterward, we collected a watch we had left for water damage repair and did some shopping. My wife found several items she liked before I headed for a beard trim. Having recently started maintaining a beard, I've discovered it demands considerable effort. Later, hunger struck, but we opted for healthy choices at Subway - my wife and I ordered Chicken Salads while my son enjoyed a Subway sandwich. We then rode our scooter home, hoping to avoid another power outage surprise. Thankfully, we encountered none. My son and I spent some time studying for his upcoming test before he expressed readiness for bed. After putting him to sleep, I decided to write this blog, making up for yesterday's missed post due to the power cut, while also completing today's entry. Now that I've finished writing, I'll edit and post it shortly.

I hope you enjoyed reading this account of our day, and I look forward to sharing another story tomorrow.
Till then.

Cheers! ðŸ¤˜
