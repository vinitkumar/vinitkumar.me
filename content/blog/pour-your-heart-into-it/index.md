Lately, we've been spending a lot of time in coffee shops. Yesterday, at the Starbucks in Amanora, Pune, I noticed a quote on the wall: "Pour Your Heart Into It."

For some reason, it struck me instantly. Maybe because, right now, I'm struggling with exactly that—fully committing myself to everything I do. It's not easy. In fact, it's incredibly difficult. But it's also worth it, especially when applied to things that truly matter. Learning to work with deep focus is a skill worth mastering.

I want to create meaningful work—work that brings both fulfillment and satisfaction. But doing so requires a mindset shift. Struggling and growing are choices, and seeing life through that lens isn't always easy. Yet, anything worth achieving demands effort. Nothing comes without hard work.

So, for me, this is a reminder to cut down on distractions and procrastination. To focus. To pour my heart into what matters.
