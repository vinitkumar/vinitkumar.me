In last couple of days, I noticed there was no good planning for my personal projects and there were lots of loose ends. So I finally cleaned up my GitHub. Here are some of ground rules for projects on GitHub: - Don't open source a project until the project has got unit test, wikis and sample application (if it is a application project) hosted. - Integrate CI like travis and jenkins with all of them. - Do all the immature, experimental projects on Bitbucket. - Write good, clean, pragmatic code in the projects on GitHub. - Look for bugs and spend more time on projects seriously. - Strictly follow Git-Flow on all your projects. Blog about your latest work or maintain the wiki for the project every work. At the end of week review your work.
