description: "Some plan for the new year"
---

2026 is here and we are already in the first week. This year, for a change, I
don't want to start with a resolution that feels forced and that we forget
about by the end of the first week.


Instead, I want to be more intentional, write more, read much more, and
have a lot of fun writing code. I want to write a huge amount of code. I want
to pick up one or two new languages and write something useful with them. I have
also become very good at using AI effectively over this past year, and I can see it
augmenting my work and improving my output by a significant margin. AI is here
to stay, and there is no denying that fact. It is also the most significant event
in our lifetime as developers.


At the same time, I want to work on many fun projects like writing a compiler
and some low-level C code (all handwritten) to sharpen my skills. I am also quite
satisfied with my Vim (NeoVim) setup and I don't want to diverge from it anymore
or spend time endlessly configuring it. I have also recently learned about Git worktrees,
and I think they change the nature and scope of concurrent work on the same
codebase, especially with AI assistance. I have been using Git since 2010 and only
recently did I discover Git worktrees, and it is excellent. This is why one
should learn the tools they use thoroughly and not just the bare minimum.


I wish you all a good and productive year ahead and a fulfilling life.
