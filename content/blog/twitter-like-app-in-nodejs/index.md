I am thinking of making a Twitter-like application as a learning exercise 
to get better at Node.js. It will be on the usual Node.js-based stack, since I am actively 
learning that now. More details will be blogged as I progress.

If you are interested in collaborating or discussing, contact me here.

Edit: I completed the Node app for Twitter. It is on my GitHub. You can check it out on my GitHub.
