Starting a new work week today. It's exciting to start the week with a bang. I have a lot of things to do this week. I have to finish the work on the new feature that I have been working on for the past 2 weeks.

I also got a new Guitar this weekend. I am excited to learn how to play it. I have been watching a lot of YouTube videos on how to play the guitar. I am excited to learn how to play the guitar. I have always wanted to learn how to play the guitar. I am excited to start this new journey. I also got a new Guitar teacher at the same music school where my kiddo goes to learn Piano. Always wanted to learn it, but can't afford it when I was in college.

I got a new wireless earphones last weekend as well. It's nice and comes with noise canceling as well. I also have an Audio Technica Headphones, but it is painful to wear with glasses. I will still use them but not while long work calls.

I also want to write more and more and get that part of my brain reactivated. I also want to read many books I got. I have a lot of things to do this week. I am excited to start this new week.


I am also working on my mindset. I want me to be more positive and grateful. I also want to be more focused towards my goal and meet my purpose.

I also started watching "The Bear - Season 3" on Disney+ Hotstar. It's a nice show. The third season is also nice. I am excited to watch the rest of the season.

At this point, these things are main goals for me:

- Complete the work on the features and bug I need to do.
- Learn Guitar and practice everyday.
- Write more and more and get that part of my brain reactivated.
- Spend more quality time with my family.
