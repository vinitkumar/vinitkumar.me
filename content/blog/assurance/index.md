Everybody faces their demons once in a while. I did too and probably continue to do so in future as well.

Wrote some of these lines to relax myself and it actually did.


> Success is not an accident. You are worth it . You are good and you are able.
It's okay to be nervous. It's okay to feel the chills.
A lot of this is okay. Relax, be yourself, Do what you always do. Solve problems, find solutions. There is only one of you.

> It's perfectly fine. Believe in yourself.
The time is now, like it has always been.

> You are good. You have talents. You are a hard working person. You do good and honest work. Believe in yourself. And you will rise.
You will lead a happy and fulfilling life. It is okay.

It's good to feel vulnerable sometimes. It's a time of self discovery and reflection for me.
