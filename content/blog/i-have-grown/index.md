Last few months has been really great for me. I think I am starting to grow as a developer and I know now how important is to keep performing at a certain level. The change started occurring when I gave up my comfort zone and started doing front-end mainly. It was a bit difficult in beginning to understand a design
from a designer's perspective and to convert it into running efficient code. I also know now that everything is important and every contribution you do in a company is worthwhile and it is worth putting all your energy in doing whatever you are doing. Now, I am looking forward to get expert level knowledge in whatever stack/technology I get to work on.
One need to be always learning and improving. I am definitely more focussed now and my goal is to do some really nice work on the products I work on. Recently, I made the main website of your product [Socialschools](HTTP://www. socialschools. nl/en/) with my very talented designer colleague Robert. It was real fun converting his great design into pixel perfect and functional website.
I enjoy writing every line of code that I get to code because this is what I love to code. P. S. I am a Civil Engineer by education, but have always loved computer so naturally was inclined to write softwares. That's it for now. Will post more about it later sometimes.
