Last few months has been really exciting for me. Since, I joined [Changer](HTTP://changer. nl) on 1st February.
Here are some things I learnt in these 5 months: - I should try to learn and own the stack I am working on. Trying to do a lot of things at a time is not going to help much.
- Contributing a lot to open source is a good thing and I am lucky my company encourages me to do so.
- I should write a lot of code and read a lot more. I should invest time in learning and understanding my product. - I should think about code quality and maintainability before I write a single line of code. It is tough things to get right at first, but with hard work I could achieve this.
- Having good understanding and relationship with the people I daily work with is important. It is must to have a smile on my face.
- I must have fun with what I do. Period!
