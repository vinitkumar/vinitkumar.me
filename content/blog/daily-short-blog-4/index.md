Thursday, February 13th was a good day.
I woke up around 5:45 AM, got my kid ready for school, and we prepared for the gym. I reached the gym by 7:35 AM and started my workout.

Today was "Back Day," and what a painful and exhausting session it turned out to be. Back muscles remain my weakest point, which becomes evident during the reps. My trainer provides great support and helps me build those muscles better. After the gym, I grabbed some nice Idli for breakfast before heading home. Though tired from the gym session, a cold shower helped rejuvenate me. After the shower, I had some egg whites, packed my bags, and left for the office.

The traffic on the way to office was manageable, and I arrived around 11:05 AM. Once there, I grabbed some coffee to get my brain functioning and reviewed the day's tasks. I read through some articles I wanted to learn from and then started coding. While checking the server logs, I noticed the code hadn't handled an edge case. I quickly patched it, pushed the code, and left it to the CI Gods to do their job. ;)

My colleague and I went for lunch afterward. The meal proved quite fulfilling, and honestly, in the office environment, I always get a little sleepy after lunch. So, I took a nice 15-minute power nap before focusing back on work. I discussed a major issue with my colleagues, and it seems we found an elegant new approach to solve it. Instead of writing code right away, I decided to document my thoughts and share them with stakeholders. Fortunately, the person who created the ticket agreed with my solution. Tomorrow, I'll implement the fix and get it working end-to-end. Once done, I packed my bags, grabbed a cold coffee from a cafÃ© near my office, and drove home. I also picked up some iceberg lettuce on the way, as we've been eating chicken salad for dinner every day. If you don't cook at home, you have no idea how much money you spend on expensive, sub-standard salads. I order chicken from Licious and lettuce from a shop near my office, and believe me, we save around Rs.500 daily compared to restaurant prices. It's also much healthier since we use the best ingredients at home.

Back home, I had a quick call with my fellow Django CMS Fellow, and we agreed on a testing approach for a major refactor in progress. I feel really positive about the direction we're taking in the Django CMS project.

Later, I called Mom and Dad and had a good conversation with them. Those of us who have parents, make sure you spend some time talking to them every day. Finally, I'll leave you with this video from the 2015 Oscars featuring JK Simmons:

Hoping for a better and productive day tomorrow as well.

Cheers! ðŸ¤˜
