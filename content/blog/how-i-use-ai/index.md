AI has been here for while now. It is getting significantly better each and everyday.
There is no denying the fact, that it will get better and the only way to survive is to adapt to it and make yourself more productive. Here is a summary of my AI usage.
I use multiple services and have not settled down on a particular one service at the moment.

- At work, we get a properly configured Cursor AI subscription.
- Github CoPilot: I use it for personal usages in my personal computer.
- ChatGPT: I use a Mac Desktop App and also an iPhone app.
- DeepSeek R1:32b: Local LLM that I have setup on both work and personal machine.
- Claude.AI: Web based site which I use from time to time.


My view of these are that at times, they are like super strong and at times, they also spit pure garbage. The tricky part is that you need to have the Wisdom to identify which is which?

Here is my experience with these AI tools:

- Cursor AI is nice; I also get their hype, but they also confidently skip code and write wrong code and if you are not too careful, you are in deep trouble my friend.  It has been quite nice for some tasks and some languages, but at times, when the questions are non-trivial, it s**ts the bed.
- Github Copilot: It's quite nice, but maybe not at the same level of brilliance as Cursor or ChatGPT.
- ChatGPT: It's probably the most used AI tool that I use for more than just coding and it's surprisingly quite good at non-coding related prompts as well.
- DeepSeek is very nice and the best is I can run on local using Ollama and don't need to worry about the privacy implications of using AI.
- Claude is quite impressive and at times it beats all other AIs for coding tasks.

At this time, I feel my usage and workflow is still in a phase of evolution. I feel AI is the next equalizer and I can really boost my productivity manifold by using it properly. I also want to use it to do deeper research on topics I don't have deep understanding of. I also use AI to correct the grammar mistakes in my prose. I feel that's a good usage of it. But I also curtail the amount of editing, I let it do, or at times just default to what I originally wrote.


One thing I really hate at times, is the CoPilot auto completing my code, which breaks my flow. I am probably going to disable that feature by default and use it only when I feel like it.
