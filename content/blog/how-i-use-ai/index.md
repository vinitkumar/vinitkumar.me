AI has been here for a while now. It is getting significantly better each and every day. There’s no denying the fact that it will continue to improve, and the only way to thrive is to adapt and use it to enhance productivity. Here’s a summary of my AI usage. I use multiple services and haven’t settled on just one yet.

At work, we have a properly configured [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/) subscription.
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot): I use it for personal projects on my own computer.
[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt): I use both the Mac desktop app and the iPhone app.
[DeepSeek R1:32B](https://www.deepseek.com/): A local LLM I’ve set up on both my work and personal machines using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).
[Claude](https://claude.ai/): A web-based AI that I use occasionally.

My take on these? Sometimes, they are incredibly powerful, and other times, they spit out pure garbage. The tricky part is having the wisdom to tell the difference.

Here’s my experience with these AI tools:

- **Cursor AI** is nice. I get the hype, but it also confidently skips code or writes incorrect code. If you’re not careful, you’re in deep trouble, my friend. It’s great for some tasks and languages, but when the questions are non-trivial, it tends to mess up.
- **GitHub Copilot** is quite nice, though maybe not at the same level of brilliance as Cursor or ChatGPT.
- **ChatGPT** is probably my most-used AI tool, not just for coding but for a variety of tasks. It’s surprisingly good at handling non-coding-related prompts as well.
- **DeepSeek** is fantastic, and the best part is that I can run it locally using Ollama, eliminating privacy concerns when using AI.
- **Claude** is impressive, and at times, it even outperforms all the others for coding tasks.

Right now, my workflow is still evolving. I see AI as the next great equalizer, a tool that can massively boost productivity when used correctly. I also want to leverage it for deeper research into topics where my understanding isn’t as strong. Additionally, I use AI to catch grammar mistakes in my writing, which I think is a great use case. However, I limit how much editing I allow it to do, often sticking with my original phrasing.

One thing I really dislike is Copilot auto-completing my code and breaking my flow. I’ll probably disable that feature by default and only use it when I actually want it.

Despite the flaws, I’m optimistic about AI’s role in my workflow. It’s not perfect, but neither am I—and together, we can get a lot done.
