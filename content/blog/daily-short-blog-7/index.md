Everyone has their demons, and I have mine too. I have struggled with consistency, which affected my blogging routine for the past two days. On Sunday, we had a busy day filled with family activities. We enjoyed lunch at a [nice Bengali Food](https://g.co/kgs/3frtVXw) restaurant in Viman Nagar. While not particularly fancy, the food there is delicious and reminds me of home cooking. I must confess that I've grown weary of typical restaurant fare, and these home-style meals nourish both body and soul. Later that afternoon, we visited Third Wave Coffee in Koregaon Park, one of our family's favorite cafes. My wife and I appreciate it for its coffee and ambiance, while our son enjoys playing Jenga and savoring cakes or cookies. After returning home, we relaxed while contemplating the upcoming Monday.

Monday began with some stress. I received a message reminding me that I was behind on an important task. This feeling lingered throughout the day, and even after returning from the office, my energy remained low. This also explains my lack of motivation to write a blog post â€“ the inspiration simply wasn't there.

This morning, after dropping my child at school, I returned home and slept, as I still wasn't feeling well. I woke up at 11 AM, realizing I was working from home today to accompany my wife to a scheduled appointment. After her appointment, I picked up my son from school. Since it was lunchtime, we dined at another excellent restaurant we've been frequenting lately â€“ Global Punjab in Seasons Mall. They serve authentic Punjabi cuisine that we thoroughly enjoy. Following a satisfying lunch, I returned to work and made significant progress on several issues.

After completing my work responsibilities, I focused on helping with dinner preparation. Later, I began coding for Django CMS open-source work. I thoroughly enjoy contributing to open-source projects, and my German colleague is excellent to work with. Now that I've recounted the events of the past three days, I'm determined to become more consistent and overcome my inner lazy demon that sometimes prevents me from maintaining daily habits.

Cheers! ðŸ¤˜
