I started programming JavaScript seriously in September 2012, and 
I never wondered that it would affect my life so much. 
Well, it started with me working on developing a Chrome Extension for an 
e-commerce/social media app. Chrome is quite different for development. 
There are lots of APIs to learn, and there are quite a few security restrictions. 
Also, there is only one language that you can use to develop it: JavaScript.

There are quite a few things I learned programming JavaScript:

- Think before you code; think about the whole problem at once.
- Keep code clean and use a modular structure.
- Use linting and follow good guidelines given by experts.
- Read some good books and be aware of what you are getting into.

Today I work as a Software Developer at an awesome Dutch startup [Changer](http://changer.nl).
