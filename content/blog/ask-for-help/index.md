If you ever worked as a software engineer, chances are you must have gotten stuck in a problem that
seemed super hard to solve. Also, if you work in sprints like setup, pretty much all your time for the 
next two weeks is booked already. What usually happens with these tricky issues is that, it would totally 
derail all your estimates and planning and you would seriously lag behind your tasks and might perform even poorly
because of the mounting time pressure.

Here are some of my suggestions based on my personal experiences working in early stage startup:

> This one trick was taught by my CEO at the time in 2013 was that if you can't figure out head or tail 
> of what to do with a problem, give it 30 mins of serious effort and ask for help. 


Why is this such a great advice? Let me break it down for you.

- Asking for help early on basically limits the amount of time that could be wasted because you are trying to figure out something for which you don't have complete context/background knowledge. If you have more experience folks at work, they can always show you a correct path and you can then follow their advise and solve it with a much higher probability than earlier.

- On the contrary if you don't ask for help and only ask the team sometime/some days later, you also put them under pressure as someone else needs to do that task in place of you abiet with more time pressure.

- All setup related issues should be immediately brought to attention of the platform/Ops/Senior developers. A good reproducible working environment is a must with any productive company.

- However, this doesn't mean that you run for cover everytime you face a problem. You should definitely try to think about a solution and probably in written format and discuss your approach without writing a single line of code. Good thing about this approach is that you peers will see that you have put some effort into the problem and discussing potential solutions to the problem, also gives them an opportunity to make your high level design for the solution better and even suggest some improvements to it.

- This is also the culture that one should teach newer/junior devs so that it becomes more of a cultural thing with the dev team.

- You don't have to suffer because of a hard problem/setup issue mostly because you are not asking for help because of your EGO. EGO has no place in a collaborative environment. It's good to know what you don't know so that you can ask help and be better at it.

- Another important thing to note here is that once should try not to ask for a same advice two times. Let me explain:

> Say you had a docker issue, and you ask your senior for help and they helped and solved your problem. It's your duty to make a note/video recording of the help, so that if you face that problem once again, you can solve it on your own next time. This saves time for everyone involved. Anyone will get annoyed if you get stuck with same problem and don't take care to take notes of the solution and keep coming back with the same problem. So making notes of the solution is great approach and it shows how much you respect the others time. 


Hope these tips would help you become a better developer and an asset to the team.
