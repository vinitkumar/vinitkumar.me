Sharing a blog link on social media and seeing the likes and shares roll in is definitely a dopamine hit, but I’ve decided to stop cross-posting my blog on social media for the foreseeable future.

I have specific goals I want to focus on deeply, and I can’t do that if I’m constantly distracted by Twitter and LinkedIn. From now on, I’ll write whatever I feel like, publish it, and leave it at that—no announcements, no notifications. If someone wants to read, they can subscribe to my blog’s RSS feed or just check in on the website from time to time.

I’m doing this to protect my mental space and avoid getting sucked into the social media vortex. So if you enjoy reading my blog, subscribe to the RSS feed or drop by occasionally.

Cheers!
