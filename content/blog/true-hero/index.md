On 26th Jan, everybody woke up to the shocking news of the untimely demise of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna
in a helicopter accident. Until that day, I had no idea who Kobe Bryant was. I am not very much into Basketball but
occasionally do check out the news.

As embarrassing as it is, I was wondering who this person was and why everybody was so much in grief. The more I read and understood, the
more I regretted not knowing about him earlier. Even though, it's such a tragic loss, his life was an exemplar example and there is so much to
learn from Kobe. He didn't only excel and was one of the all-time greats but also he was such a nice human being and a total inspiration.

Just watched this video and I couldn't resist writing this post. Thank You, Kobe. Even in death, you are an inspiration to so many of us. RIP
