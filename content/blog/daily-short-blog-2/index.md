Today was a hectic day. It started with getting up kid to School at 7am and then getting ready as we needed to
go to his school at 9am. I also had to go to office today, was had to be ready for office before that. Last night
sleep was bit disturbed and I woke up couple of times at least. Summer is already here in Pune and it's not fun at all.

At work, it was a mixed day, progress some on the planning, but there are some minor roadblocks on other aspects that
needs some more work. I was also doing a bit more progress with React Router tutorial and it got a bit tiring at the end
so dropped doing it during the day. I also made some small fixes to my `json2xml` project, even though it is not a lot,
it is some progress. I guess some days, you should just take whatever win that comes your way. Coming back from office,
got a flat tyre and that means tomorrow need to take my Scooty to the tyre shop. I hate this hassle, but guess some times
there is no way around it.

Also, in the morning, went to a nice cafe with wifey and had my favourite Vietnamese Shakerato and love it. Now, before
going to bed, want to make some progress with the book I am reading recently on Kindle called as "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering",
by Richard W. Hamming.

Hoping for a better and fulfilling tomorrow.


Cheers! ðŸ¤˜
