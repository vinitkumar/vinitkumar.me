Today was a hectic day. It started with getting my kid to school at 7am, and then getting ready as we needed to
go back to his school at 9am. I also had to go to the office today, so I had to be ready before that. Last night's
sleep was a bit disturbed and I woke up at least a couple of times. Summer is already here in Pune and it's not fun at all.

At work, it was a mixed day. Made some progress on the planning, but there are minor roadblocks on other aspects that
need more work. I was also making progress with the React Router tutorial, but it got a bit tiring at the end
so I dropped it during the day. I made some small fixes to my `json2xml` project - even though it's not a lot,
it's still progress. I guess some days, you should just take whatever win comes your way. Coming back from the office,
I got a flat tire and that means tomorrow I need to take my Scooty to the tire shop. I hate this hassle, but I guess sometimes
there's no way around it.

Also, in the morning, I went to a nice cafe with wifey and had my favorite Vietnamese Shakerato - loved it! Now, before
going to bed, I want to make some progress with the book I'm currently reading on Kindle called "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering"
by Richard W. Hamming.

Hoping for a better and more fulfilling tomorrow.


Cheers! ðŸ¤˜
