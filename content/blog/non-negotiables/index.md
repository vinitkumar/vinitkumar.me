I wrote this flying to Delhi a week before without internet/distractions on my journal.
Here, I just porting it to the digital format, so that I can refer to it anytime.
Or share it with someone who might find it useful.


Just like Carmy wrote on the series "The Bear", about the [non-negotiables](https://screenrant.com/the-bear-season-3-carmy-non-negotiables-explained/), I want to write mine as a software artist.
I say "Software Artist" because that is who I am at the core.
