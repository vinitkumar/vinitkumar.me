In the age of layoffs and company closures, job security is a myth. But there
are ways to make yourself indispensable. Here are some tips:

- Do focused work every single day without fail. Consistency is the key.
- Be nice with your colleagues and collaborate effectively.
- Keep learning new skills and technologies and be proficient at it.
- Learn how to write testable code and have an ability to write good tests.
- Don't waste time on Social Media while at work. It's a productivity killer.
- Try too see the bigger picture and understand how your work fits in the grand
  scheme of things. Also, foresee if you don't fit and find a way out of that
  situation.
- Work hard, very hard, every single day. Make it an habit of working hard and
  trying to improve yourself every single day. Consistency is the key and pays
  off handsomely in the long run.
- Be punctual and respect others time. If you have a meeting at 10:00, be there
  at 9:55. It shows that you respect others time and are serious about your work.
- Being great at what you do is probably the only "Real Job Security" you can
  have. If you are great at what you do, you will always have a job. Companies
  will always need people who are great at what they do.
