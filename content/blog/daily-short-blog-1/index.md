Writing blog is something that is close to my heart and I thoroughly enjoy the process. It
also calms down the chaos inside me. I have decided to write one every single day. It doesn't have to
be long, just one paragraph will do as well as long as I am being honest.


Today morning was a slow start and I didn't wanted to travel to office. Also, my kid missed his school, so I thought
will just work remotely today. In the morning, got some important meetings with teammates and decided on the work that
I need to do in the coming few weeks. At work, we are building a very cool feature which would work on all the major OSes.
I am lucky to be able to play a major part in this process. I have also been enjoying writing TypeScript quite a bit
for this project. The other part of this is in Go and that is quite fun to write a well. Coming from writing Python for 12
straight years, working with Type Safe languages is a breath of fresh air. However, the work is by no means trivial and I am learning
/re-learning tonnes while working on it. I am really looking forward to shipping this to all our customers soon.

At Open Source front, I am going to ship a major demo project integrating React with Django CMS. However, React Router
has undergone a major update and I need to learn a lot of things. My other team mate in Django CMS, Fabian is on Fire and It's
sometime hard to catch up with him. At the same time, I am proud of the progress we have been making off late.


I have also decide to work on my anger issues. Recently, I have let myself into stressful situations and I have vowed to not
subject me to those situations anymore and keep myself first while interacting with folks.  Yesterday, also catch up with my friend
from college and his family and we had a nice time. Today, I also missed my Gym Session, as I just wanted to sleep in today. I have
accumulated a lot of sleep debt and want to do better on it.


Alright, that's it for now. Will post another update tomorrow.

Cheers! ðŸ¤˜
