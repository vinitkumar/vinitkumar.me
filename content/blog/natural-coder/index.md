I am a natural coder. I have always been someone who writes software because I enjoy it. I have over a decade of experience with Python and JavaScript, but I enjoy working with any language or framework and quickly become proficient. However, of late, I have struggled with some aspects, and upon introspection, I realize it boils down to trying to copy others' styles and ways of working rather than honing my natural abilities and doing something for enjoyment rather than for other goals.

Goals such as trying to prove myself at a new job or cementing my role as an OSS community leader. The problem with these is that I constantly feel under pressure and am not doing it for fun. This will only lead to burnout.

I just want to be my own cheerleader and a reasonable critic, doing honest work every day. On top of these things, I will focus on activities that I enjoy and only spend a limited amount of time on them so that I crave them more and more.

I hate the constant feeding frenzy that short-form content has made us addicted to. So, no more constant dopamine-seeking; I want to do it for fun and enjoyment while writing the best possible code with the tools at hand.

That's it. That's the goal. Wish me luck!!
