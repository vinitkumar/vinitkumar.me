After a lot of reflection on what I have achieved in the last year, I have stumbled upon one fact: I need to hack
a lot more on Python and JavaScript. These are the two main languages I am comfortable with, and almost all my projects
and official work are done with them.

Well, here are some small ideas about how I am going to achieve this:

- Read a lot of good code. I will spend at least 1 hour every day reading some really awesome Python code.
- Write a lot of commonly used utilities in Python. For example: Automate at least one of the tasks I do daily using Python.
- Read Django documentation and toy with it.
- Write PEP8-compliant code.

These were the ideas for Python. Now for JavaScript:

- Give a solid foundation to my understanding of prototypical inheritance in JavaScript.
- Write a lot of Backbone and some really good jQuery code.
- Read some really good code and write some CoffeeScript as well.
- Learn to write good unit tests in Jasmine and Mocha.
